Calibrate Charger current
Decide on using current only @ hardcoded 240 V
Solar sensor (optional)--needs 10uF cap.
replace faulty PSU 
build case
mount switches

TEST PLAN

(1) Current Limit observed - Lead Acid, set low current limit
(2) Voltage limit observed - Lead Acid, set low voltage limit
(3) Overshoot tuning, might be unnecessary delay using CT clamp for charger current
(4) Shutdown PSUS when grid goes from -ve to +ve.
(5) Startup PSUS when grid goes from +ve to -ve.
(6) Using GTI simultaneously , too dangerous , or will it be fast enough.
(7) Ethernet switchover. does rasppi pick up metrics.
