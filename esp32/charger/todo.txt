Battery is 2.5% too low 
also use 100 samples.
when charger on range should be 0 to 100
when charger off range should be -100 to 0

turnPowerOff we can subtract 100 from each limit
turnPowerOn add 100 to each.

-Use pot to adjust voltage for 8V out.
-Use pot to get 14V out.
-F-or each measure voltage, then disconnect pot and measure Ra and Rb 
-w-rite it all down 

-change opto boards 100 ohm resistor for larger one
-and the 470 ohm resistor for smaller one based on Ra and Rb above

-test on breadboard on bench so we get full range.
-Could use -12V to +5 and some different resistors ???
-Could try -12 and +12 ???


Get Date from NTP 
Decide on charger times....e.g.... stab 1
Could just put the growatt on a timer plug !
7am ...set range 200 to 300
11...set range 100 to 200
3pm ...set range -200 to 0


--Rewire CT clamp for GTI as per diagram
--Mount 8 relay to plyboard at far left BUT MAKE SURE IT'S DETACHABLE so we can service the PSU'S
--Find pin to control GTI and write code.
--When powering ON charger, turnOffGti , when powering OFF charger, turnOnGti.
--Test.
---Fit new PSU in middle using bolts for power , DETACHABLE in case it pops again
---Analyse why it takes 10 seconds for charger to react to grid going -ve


-Find a working pin for the power relay on the charger sketch(think its on 39)
-Build new op-amp circuit for GTI CT clamp wired to old relay pin 
-Move GTI into rough initial_position
-Add switch wired up to MAIN input for GTI
-Write code to get GTI power and add it to the CSV output string.
-peel backing off breadboard and secure
-secure wires & tape up joints

-Make sides 
-Make front
-Cutout holes for Network 
-Cutout holes for power 
-Cutout holes for vents 
-line up GTI at correct height
-Cutout holes for GTI terminals
-Then drill holes for charger terminals in-line with GTI terminals.
-Screw together loosely , clean all dust, and wrap it.
-Fit bolts 
-Solder connecttors 
-make busbars to connect to GTI
